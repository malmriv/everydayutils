# R lab
Little R scripts that don't deserve a repository of their own. So far:
  - **fourier.R**: performs a FFT of any time series. Still have to implement an option to account for the presence of any type of up or down-going tendency, but it works fine for most purposes if the data has been nicely formatted.
  - **mandelplot.R**: generates a nice picture of the selected coordinates in the Mandelbrot set. Can be easily modified to generate zooming animations (see [my guide](https://malmriv.github.io/posts/2020/04/make-animations-with-R/)).
